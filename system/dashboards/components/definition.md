| TPT Management | This indicator shows the proportion of eligible clients among TX CURR who either completed TPT at their last visit. The difference between numerator and denominator produces a line list of clients who should be initiated on TPT or have not completed TPT. | TX_CURR                                                                                           |**TPT completed (Purple):**  TPT actual stop date is filled out, and the difference between completion date and initiation date is at least:  - 70 days if regimen is 3HP  - 146 days if regimen is 6H, 9H, or not listed <br> **Currently on TPT/TB treatment (yellow):**  Initiated but not yet due to complete based on their regimen:  - Current date is <113 days from initiation date for 3HP  - Current date is <240 days for 6H  <br> **Incomplete TPT or never initiated TPT (red):**  - Initiation date is filled but actual stop date has not been filled in even though it has been:  >112 days for someone who started 3HP  >239 days for those who started 6H, 9H, or regimen not listed.  - Actual completion date is filled in but is less than the minimum recommended duration for the regimen they are on. | **Numerator**: TPT Completed  <br> **Denominator**: TX_CURR  All three categories (TPT Completed, Currently on TPT/TB treatment, Incomplete TPT or never initiated TPT) should add up to TX_CURR <br> <br> **Score card**: <br> - Red: <80% <br> - Yellow: 80-90% <br> - Green: >90% | Pediatrics: 0-19  Adults: >19 |
| Retention      | Early retention tells us whether the clients that have been confirmed HIV positive are still in care. The difference between numerator and denominator produces a line list of eligible clients who are at risk of becoming formally lost, interrupted in treatment, and should be immediately traced. | All patients with a next appointment date either in the future or no more than 90 days before the end of the reporting period | **In care (Grey):**  - Patient is currently in care; their next visit date is after the day the report is run.  <br>**Missed appointment (Yellow):**  - Patient is ≤28 days after their last appointment, which they did not show up for.  <br>**Treatment interruptions (Red):**  - Patient is >28 days but ≤90 days after their last appointment, which they did not show up for.                                                                                                                              | **Numerator**: In Care + Missed Appointments <br> **Denominator**: In Care + Missed Appointments + Treatment Interruptions <br> <br> **Score card**: <br> - Red: <90% <br> - Yellow: 90-95% <br> - Green: >95%                                                                                      | All  <br> Men ages 20-39  <br> Pediatrics: 0-19  <br> PBFW                  |
| VLM            | This indicator shows the proportion of eligible clients who had a viral load test and have a documented result.

| VLS            | This indicator shows the proportion of TX_CURR clients who were monitored according to guidelines or slightly delayed and were suppressed/had an undetectable VL.
